    Computes the thickness of the roots and antiroots using the Airy hypothesis

    On continental points:

    .. math ::

        ar = \frac{\rho_{lc} - \rho_w}{\rho_m - \rho_{lc}} b

    density of the water and $\rho_{uc}$ and $\rho_{lc}$ are the density of the
    upper and lower crust respectively. If $T$ is the normal thickness of the
    Earh's crust, $T + r$ and $T + ar$ are the isostatic Moho at the cotinental
    and oceanic points respectively.


    Parameters
    ----------
    density_mantle : float
        Mantle density in kg/m続.
    density_upper_crust : float
        Density of the upper crust in kg/m続.
    density_lower_crust : float
        Density of the lower crust in kg/m続.
    density_water : float
        Water density in kg/m続.
    topography : array
        Topography height and bathymetry depth in meters.

    Returns
    -------
    root : array
         Thickness of the roots and antiroot in meters.
